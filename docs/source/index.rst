Welcome to the Lab!
===================================

**Lab name** is an interdisciplinary group whose mission focuses on helping people lead healthier and happier lives. We aim to inform the design of better health-promoting interventions and policies to achieve health for all. Our work is at the intersection of digital health and health neuroscience, combining frameworks across affective, cognitive, and developmental sciences to best answer our research questions.

We are developing methods and conducting studies that allow us to intervene early, understand whole-person health (mind and body), support wellbeing in everyday life, and examine the complex interplay among factors influencing wellbeing. 

* We believe that intervening early (e.g., supporting caregivers and families and intervening at school) is critical for positively influencing health trajectories for all. 
* We believe that integrating mind and body as well as understanding personal contextual factors (family, neighborhood, school, culture) is important for achieving health and wellbeing for all.
* We believe that designing ecologically-valid interventions that people can draw upon at any moment in their daily lives is critical for supporting wellbeing for all.
* We believe that population health efforts should include personalized efforts that target health communication and behavior change in the digital space.
* We believe that in order to design interventions and policies with the most promise of reducing health inequities, we need to use methods that allow us to model the complex interplay among factors influencing health within the individual as well as in their complex environments (e.g., family, neighborhood, school, etc.).
* We believe that one size does not fit all.
